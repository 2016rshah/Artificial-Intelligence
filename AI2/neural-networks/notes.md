calcFeedForward:
	The fancy graph thing
	input of set of weights to test and training set
	output of output at each node
After calcFeedforward you can calculate error


calcgradient


applygradientweights
where alpha refers to like .1
currWeights += alpha * correspondingGradient
Basically you are just saying that based on these weights
You would improve if you go in that direction
